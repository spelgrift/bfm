				<p><small><strong>Space needs:</strong> To do all of our tricks we need 14 ft x 14ft performance area and 14ft height clearance. We prefer a wood floor or concrete. It is very difficult for us to perform our show on grass, gravel or on an incline. If the space is smaller we can adjust our show to fit the space.</small></p>

		<h3>Bubble Show</h3>
		<p>The bubble show is a great hit for younger children and is also fun for the older kids and even adults. It is a very interactive show with the kids taking turns making the bubbles. It is also a great photo opportunity.</p>
		<p>The show is 40 minutes long. Recommended for ages 0-6. </p>

		<p><small><strong>Space needs:</strong> We need a large indoor area for the show, at least 10x10 ft for the stage area, plus additional space for the children to sit. We can not guarantee the kid-inside-a-bubble trick outside.</small></p>
